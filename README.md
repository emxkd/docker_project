# docker_project

## Description
Ghost is an open source, professional publishing platform build on a modern Node.js technology stack. Because ghost is commpletely open souce, build as a JSON API, has webhooks, and gives full control over the front-end, it essentially integrates with absolutely everything. Browse a large directory of integration with instructions, or built any manner of custom integration yourself by writing a little javascript and markup to do whatever needed.
